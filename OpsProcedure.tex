Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item P\&ID is attached in the end of this list. Valve labels have been changed.
\item We have to avoid air flowing into the LAr filter and the plumbing system, which will compromise the filter and the LAr purity.  Check the valves' status carefully.
\item Every time when we have air in a section of the plumbing system (typically before V0 when starting filling LAr from a new dewar), do close V4 and open the purging valve, V3.
\item RTD2 (the bottom one) is not available in this run, but it is repetitive to RTD1.
\item RTD3 in this run is connected to Cryocon channel B.
\item We want to take LArPix data during filling (but after the vessel is at $\ge$ atmospheric pressure).
\item Need to turn off the LArPix tile before ramping up the high voltage.
\end{itemize}
